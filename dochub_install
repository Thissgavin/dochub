一、mariadb数据库

1、安装mariadb数据库
  
  #yum -y install mariadb mariadb-server
  
2、启动mariadb数据库

  #systemctl start mariadb
  #systemctl enable mariadb
  
3、为mariadb设置root密码

  [root@docker1 ~]# mysql_secure_installation 

  NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
        SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

  In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
  password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
  you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
  so you should just press enter here.

  Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
  OK, successfully used password, moving on...

  Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
  root user without the proper authorisation.

  Set root password? [Y/n] y
  New password: 
  Re-enter new password: 
  Password updated successfully!
  Reloading privilege tables..
   ... Success!

  By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
  to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
  them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
  go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
  production environment.

  Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
   ... Success!

  Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
  ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

  Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] n
   ... skipping.

  By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
  access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
  before moving into a production environment.

  Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y^Hn
  Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] n
   ... skipping.

  Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
  will take effect immediately.

  Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
   ... Success!

  Cleaning up...

  All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
  installation should now be secure.
  
4、设置utf8字符集

  #vim /etc/my.cnf
  [mysqld]
  init_connect='SET collation_connection = utf8_unicode_ci'
  init_connect='SET NAMES utf8'
  character-set-server=utf8
  collation-server=utf8_unicode_ci
  skip-character-set-client-handshake
  datadir=/var/lib/mysql
  socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

  #vim /etc/my.cnf.d/mysql-cliets.cnf
  [mysql]
  default-character-set=utf8

  #vim /etc/my.cnf.d/client.cnf
  [client]
  default-character-set=utf8

5、查看字符集

  #mysql -u root -qj
  show variables like "%character%";
  show variables like "%collation%";
  
6、创建数据库

  #mysql -u root -qj
  #create database dochubdb

二、安装dochub
1、下载dochub V2.3

#wget https://github.com/TruthHun/DocHub/releases/download/v2.3/DocHub.V2.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz

2、解压

#tar xvf DocHub.V2.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz

3、执行

#./DocHub

4、访问本机IP进行安装
